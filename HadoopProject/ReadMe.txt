Applying

Hadoop map-reduce to derive some statistics from Yelp Dataset.
The dataset files are located in hdfs in the following path,
/yelpdatafall/business/business.csv.
/yelpdatafall/review/review.csv.
/yelpdatafall/user/user.csv.

In class there will be brief demo/ discussion about how to access the cluster and the dataset.


Dataset Description.
The dataset comprises of three csv files, namely user.csv, business.csv and review.csv.  

Business.csv file contain basic information about local businesses. 
Business.csv file contains the following columns "business_id","full_address","categories"

'business_id': (a unique identifier for the business)
'full_address': (localized address), 
'categories': [(localized category names)]  

review.csv file contains the star rating given by a user to a business. Use user_id to associate this review with others by the same user. Use business_id to associate this review with others of the same business. 

review.csv file contains the following columns "review_id","user_id","business_id","stars"
 'review_id': (a unique identifier for the review)
 'user_id': (the identifier of the reviewed business), 
 'business_id': (the identifier of the authoring user), 
 'stars': (star rating, integer 1-5),the rating given by the user to a business

user.csv file contains aggregate information about a single user across all of Yelp
user.csv file contains the following columns "user_id","name","url"
user_id': (unique user identifier), 
'name': (first name, last initial, like 'Matt J.'), this column has been made anonymous to preserve privacy 
'url': url of the user on yelp


After being familiar with the data - I wrote efficient Hadoop Map-Reduce programs in Java to find the following information ::


Q1. 
 List each business Id that are located in “Palo Alto” using the full_address column as the filter column. 

Sample output:

23244444
232ewe33

Q2 

Find the top ten rated businesses using the average ratings. 
Recall that star column in review.csv file represents the rating.

Please answer the question by calculating the average ratings given to each business using the review.csv file. 

Sample output:
business id              
xdf12344444444


Q3:
List the  business_id , full address and categories of the Top 10 businesses using the average ratings.  

This will require you to use  review.csv and business.csv files.

Please use reduce side join and job chaining technique to answer this problem.


Sample output:
business id               full address           categories                                    avg rating
xdf12344444444,      CA 91711       List['Local Services', 'Carpet Cleaning']	5.0






Q4: 
List the 'user id' and 'stars' of users that reviewed businesses located in Stanford 
Required files are 'business'  and 'review'.

Please use Map side join technique to answer this problem.
Hint: Please load all data in business.csv file into the distributed cache. 

Sample output
                                                   
	       
User id	stars
0WaCdhr3aXb0G0niwTMGTg	4.0


The sample output after execution is present in the OutputFiles folder.
The jar files for processing each question are present in the jarFiles folder.
